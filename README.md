# Predictive Modeling / Process Note / Demand Generation Plan for NoBroker

**Analysis**

Q1. Attached is a dataset of RMs for the month of April [calls done, rejects, visits] - filename = Assignment_1 (1).xlsx
a) How will you measure the overall productivity of the team based on these numbers?
b) Create a predictive model to forecast the visit count overall for the next month
c) Given the poor performance of RM Rohan in April month, suggest 3 specific ways of pulling up his productivity

**Policy and Process Note**

Q1. We need a clear policy for tracking our schedules and converting them to visits. The policy must include incentives for good conversions (>60% scheduled to visit) and penalties for poor conversions (<40% scheduled to visit). Draft a policy and process note for the same.
Q2. We need a clear policy for converting our interested customers to final bookings. The policy must include incentives for good conversions (>60% interested in booking) and penalties for poor conversions (<40% interested in booking). Draft a policy and process note for the same. Given that this step has a lot of externalities like developer support, pricing changes, inventory availability, etc, add exceptions to the policy basis the same.

**Demand Generation**

Q1. Create a demand generation plan for a new project launch where we expect to generate 200 walk-ins and 40 conversions within 2 months. You can assume any project launch basis your geographical awareness. Assume 50% traction through No-broker platform and 50% traction through external marketing activities.
